<h1>About Me</h1>

  My name is Sandesh Khatiwada, born on August 23, 1995, in the tranquil village
  of Jyamire, Chitwan, Nepal. Growing up in a nurturing environment with my
  father, mother, grandmother, and two sisters, I was imbued with values of
  discipline and respect from a young age. This solid foundation guided me
  through my educational journey, where I completed high school with a focus on
  science. The analytical skills and problem-solving abilities I developed
  during this time paved the way for my foray into the world of computer
  programming.

  Outside of my career, I lead a well-rounded life filled with diverse interests
  that bring me joy and relaxation. Whether I'm experimenting with new recipes
  in the kitchen, enjoying a serene day of fishing, engaging in a competitive
  game of FIFA, strumming my guitar, or expressing myself through singing, these
  hobbies offer a creative balance to my disciplined work life. Each of these
  activities enriches my daily experiences and highlights my multifaceted
  approach to life, blending professional dedication with personal passion and
  creativity.
